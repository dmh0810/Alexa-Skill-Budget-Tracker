# Alexa-Skill-Budget-Tracker

For the project work in the seminar "Information Systems", our team also developed the Alexa Skill Budget Tracker that keeps track of user's incomes and expenses on an individual basis and furthermore warns user in case of an overexpenditure. The account balance can either be stored in the memory and accumulated over a period or calculated anew, based on user's demand.
